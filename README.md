# gag (gradle-android-git)

This is a Gradle plugin to manage Android dependency using Git.
Usually, libraries are versioned with group, name and version numbers and you can download from Maven Central repository or jcenter.  
But sometimes you might want to use not versioned library.  
This project enables you to manage those libraries
in your Android app build process.

## With this plugin...

* You don't have to upload your library jars/aars to external Maven repository servers

* You will be noticed when to update the dependencies

    * Like CocoaPod, Bundler, you can specify library's version with Git commit hash or tags.
    * When you have to update, your build will fails.
    * If you want to upgrade, just execute 1 command.

* You can develop Android library with other apps

    * Like CocoaPod, you can choose dependency's origin from remote repositories or local path.

## Usage

This plugin works in your local environment, but not released to `mavenCentral` nor `jcenter` yet.  
Please build this plugin and `uploadArchive` to your local repository.

To use this plugin:

1. Create your `gag.gradle` and execute `update` (see "Setting up gag.gradle" section below)
1. Edit your `build.gradle` (see "Setting up build.gradle" section below)
1. Build your app (see "Build your app" section below)

### Setting up gag.gradle

At first, write `gag.gradle` (or whatever you like) like following contents.  
This includes dependencies definitions.  
You must add this file to your VCS.

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            // Currently, gag is not provided on mavenCentral()
            url uri('../repo')
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.ksoichiro:gradle-android-git:0.1.+'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'gag'

// Dependency configuration
git {
    // Local library directories. ".gag" is default
    directory = ".gag"

    dependencies {
        // Use older version by commit hash (Detached HEAD)
        repo location: 'https://github.com/ksoichiro/AndroidFormEnhancer.git', name: 'afe', libraryProject: 'androidformenhancer', groupId: 'com.github.ksoichiro', commit: '5a9492f45fd0f97289001a7398d04c59b846af40'

        // Use older version by tag (Detached HEAD)
        repo location: 'https://github.com/ksoichiro/SimpleAlertDialog-for-Android.git', name: 'sad', libraryProject: 'simplealertdialog', groupId: 'com.github.ksoichiro', tag: 'v1.1.1'

        // Closure style configuration
        repo {
            location = 'https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock.git'
            name = 'abs'
            libraryProject = 'actionbarsherlock'
            groupId = 'com.actionbarsherlock'
            commit = '4a79d536af872339899a90d6dc743aa57745474b'
            // If the project does not contain gradle wrapper,
            // gag will generate with `gradleVersion` version.
            gradleVersion = '1.6'
        }
    }
}

defaultTasks 'update'
```

After that, execute this:

```sh
$ ./gradlew -b gag.gradle
or
$ ./gradlew -b gag.gradle update
```

This will clone all the repositories, check out, assemble and upload archive to `.gag/.repo`.

`.gag` directory is just a working directory, so you must add `.gag/` to your `.gitignore`.

### Setting up build.gradle

Your `build.gradle` doesn't look so different.  
Just edit your `repositories` and `dependencies` to use `.gag/.repo` contents.

```groovy
:
android {
    :
}

// Add repository generated by gag.
repositories {
    maven {
        url uri('.gag/.repo')
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:20.0.+'

    // Define dependencies with commit hash or tags
    compile 'com.github.ksoichiro:androidformenhancer:5a9492f45fd0f97289001a7398d04c59b846af40@aar'
    compile 'com.github.ksoichiro:simplealertdialog:v1.1.1@aar'
    compile 'com.actionbarsherlock:actionbarsherlock:4a79d536af872339899a90d6dc743aa57745474b@aar'
}
```

### Build your app

Build your app as you always do.  
For example:

```sh
$ ./gradlew installDebug
```

If somebody in your team updated dependencies with new commit hash or tags, your build will fail because Gradle can't resolve dependencies.  
If you see that kind of errors, just `update`:

```sh
$ ./gradlew -b gag.gradle
or
$ ./gradlew -b gag.gradle update
```
